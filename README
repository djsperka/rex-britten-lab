This folder contains source for the Britten Lab. The code is used in conjunction 
with REX and requires modifications to the Makefiles so the REX variable points
to the correct REX root folder. 

libbrit - this folder contains source files for a library of utilities. The utilities
          are used heavily in REX paradigms, and so are built here. 
		  
sset - this folder contains lab-specific paradigms and headers. In the past we've
       put all this in the rex sset folder. That's fine, until you want to change REX
	   versions (admittedly not a common practice). As long as the Makefile 
	   has the correct reference to the rex root folder (make sure the var REX is set
	   correctly), then building here is the same as building within the REX sset 
	   folder:
	   
	   make sf=whatever
	   
	   To make a paradigm that has extra source file
	   
	   make sf=whatever LSRC=src.c
	   
	   
	   To make a paradigm that has two extra source files
	   
	   make sf=whatever LSRC="src1.c src2.c"
