Notes for collecting steering data and transferring data to unagi


REX: Steps for collecting steering data
---------------------------------------

0. Select paradigm from Processes window and hit "Run".
1. Load root file and set other parameters if needed. 
2. Hit "Clock Off" button to start the clock. 
3. Open data file
 a. Rex main window: File > Open Data File
 b. Navigate to correct folder: /data/steer
 c. Enter base filename, e.g. fstr112707a or fstr20071127a
    REX will append an "A"("E") to the filename for analog(event) data. 
 d. Hit "Open". Filename will be written at top of REX main window (you may
    not see the entire filename!)

 e. ***IMPORTANT***   Reset States  *** IMPORTANT ***

 f. Hit "Paradigm Stopped" (red) button to start paradigm. 

4. Close data file (with paradigm still running)
 a. File > Close Data File

5. To check for data, 

 a. open a terminal window and navigate to the data folder:

# cd /data/steer

 b. this command will list all files and sizes, with the most recently created
    files LAST:

# ls -lrt

 c. The data files with "A" and "E" are the analog and event data, respectively.
    A file size of 512 means the file has no data! 


Transferring data to unagi
--------------------------

1. This should be done after data acquisition is complete. The file transfer
can slow REX down so that frames are dropped.

2. Open a terminal window. 
3. Change dir to the data folder

# cd /data/steer

4. Establish a web connection with this command:

# webon

5. Check that the connection is established with this command:

# ifconfig

The results of this command give info on all tcp/ip connections. Only one 
matters here - it is labelled "en1:". Beneath the "en1" heading there should 
be a line that starts with "inet:". It is followed by a group of 4 numbers
separated by dots ".". 

If the numbers read "128.120.140.xxx", where "xxx" may be anything from 1-255, 
then there is a connection and you can go to the next step. 

If the numbers read "0.0.0.0", the connection is not
established yet. Just wait a bit and try the "ifconfig" command again. You 
don't need to re-enter the "webon" command!!! It may take as long as a few 
minutes for the connection to be established. 

6. To transfer the files to unagi (to Heidi's account), follow these steps. 
I am assuming here that we will transfer the files for a single day's work. 
Let's assume that the file names used (when the REX data file was opened)
are all "fstr112707a", "fstr112707b", ...

 a. connect to unagi with this command

# sftp her@unagi.ucdavis.edu

you should get a prompt that looks like this:

sftp> 

 b. Change directories on unagi:

sftp> cd steering/data

 c. Transfer the files. Note the placement of the "*". This is a "wildcard"
and means "any other letters or numbers that make up a complete filename". 

sftp> put fstr112707*

 d. Exit sftp

sftp> quit
