General
-------

Menu items should not have spaces in their names, and the names should be <25 char long. 

For example

VLIST background_vl[] = {
"Background_color(R)", &background_color[0], 0, NP, 0, ME_DEC,	
"Background_color(G)", &background_color[1], 0, NP, 0, ME_DEC,
"Background_color(B)", &background_color[2], 0, NP, 0, ME_DEC,
NS,
};


Notice that the names are "Background_color", not "Background color". 
Using spaces makes the parsing of root files fail.

Steering paradigm
-----------------

Use dotsize >= 2 or you'll get flickering dots, especially near the horizon.

Dot density around 100 per square (1000x1000) is good. If you run this up to 1000, you'll start dropping frames.
